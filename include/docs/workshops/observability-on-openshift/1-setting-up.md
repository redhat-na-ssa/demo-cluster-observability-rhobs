## Instructions

### Install Operators

The observability stack in this demo will take advantage of these operators:

- **Red Hat Cluster Observability Operator**: Installs a complete observability
  stack (logging, metrics, and tracing) with OpenShift Console UI plugins for
  local observability.
- **Red Hat Cluster Logging Operator (CLO)**: Installs
  [Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector), a high-performance metrics
  forwarder, and enables centralized configuration and customization.
- **Red Hat Build of OpenTelemetry (OTel)**: Provides high-performance,
  low-latency signal collection, transformation and export with
  enterprise-friendly defaults.

We will also use these operators to simulate external systems often found in
enterprise observability platforms:

- **Streams for Apache Kafka**: A Kubernetes-native platform for microservices
  communication with Kafka. We'll be focusing on Kafka primitives (mostly
  topics) in this demo.
- **Perses**: An open-source, CNCF-sponsored dashboard tool for metrics, logs and traces.

The installation process for all of these operators is the same. Repeat the
steps below for each of the operators on this list.

1. From the OpenShift console, click on **Ecosystem**, then on **Software
   Catalog** to view the list of operators available in your cluster.

![](./include/assets/img/ecosystem.png)

2. Search for the operator to install, then click on "Install." Review the
   defaults presented, then click on "Install" to complete the installation.

3. The OpenShift Console will notify you when the operator has been installed.

### Enable Cluster Platform Monitoring

Every OpenShift cluster ships with the **OpenShift Monitoring operator**. This
operator installs cluster-wide Prometheus, Thanos and Alertmanager as well, a
default node exporter and some preconfigured alerts.

However, cluster monitoring is not enabled by default. To enable it, create a
special `ConfigMap` in the `openshift-monitoring` namespace called
`cluster-monitoring-config` with an empty `config.yaml` key in its `data` field.

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: ""
```

Wait a minute for the OpenShift Monitoring operator to apply the new
changes. Afterwards, visit the OpenShift console and click on **Observe** >
**Metrics**. Click on the dropdown underneath **Queries** and select **CPU
Usage**. A line graph of CPU usage for all workloads in the cluster should
appear along with a tabular outline of this data.

> 📝 **NOTE**
>
> The **Cluster Observability Operator** provides the
> **MonitoringStack** resource to configuring separate Prometheus instances to
> better isolate metrics by workload or application domain. This is out of scope
> for this demo, but you can learn more about this custom resource
> [here](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/1-latest/pdf/installing_red_hat_openshift_cluster_observability_operator/configuring-the-cluster-observability-operator-to-monitor-a-service#creating-a-monitoringstack-object-for-cluster-observability-operator_configuring_the_cluster_observability_operator_to_monitor_a_service).

### Create namespaces

This environment uses three namespaces:

- **openshift-observability**: Hosts Tempo and the OpenTelemetry collector.
- **openshift-logging**: Hosts Loki and the ClusterLogForwarder that ships logs
  to Kafka, our external signals gathering system.
- **rhobs-messaging**: Hosts our "external" Kafka cluster.

Use `oc` to create them:

```sh
for ns in openshift-observability openshift-logging rhobs-messaging
do oc create ns "$ns"
done
```

Because our OpenTelemetryCollector will surface cluster metrics and node logs,
we will need to modify our `openshift-observability` namespace to allow
privileged pods. Use `oc` to do this as well:

```sh
oc annotate ns openshift-observability  \
  security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync="false" \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce="privileged" \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit="privileged" \
  pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn="privileged"
```

### Create service accounts

Next, we will create two service accounts:

- A service account that will enable the OpenTelemetry collector to collect
  cluster metrics, events and logs and publish traces to the cluster's Tempo
  instance, and
- A service account that enables Vector to retrieve cluster and workload logs
  through the ClusterLogForwarder.

#### OpenTelemetry Collector and Tempo

Create a `ServiceAccount` called `rhobs-sa`:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: rhobs-sa
  namespace: openshift-observability
EOF
```

Next, use  a `ClusterRoleBinding` to allow this service account to create
privileged pods (required for surfacing node logs):

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: rhobs-sa-allow-privileged
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: system:openshift:scc:privileged
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: rhobs-sa
  namespace: openshift-observability
EOF
```

Next, create a `ClusterRole` to give this service account the ability to
retrieve Kubernetes resource information thorugh the Downward API, and create a
`ClusterRoleBinding` to assign this role to our service account:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: otel-collector
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: rhobs-sa-assign-otel-collector-role
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: otel-collector
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: rhobs-sa
  namespace: openshift-observability
EOF
```

Finally, we need to give `rhobs-sa` the ability to log into Tempo so that our
OpenTelemetry collector can forward traces into it. Repeat the process above to
create a `ClusterRole` and `ClusterRoleBinding` that enables this capability:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: tempo-allow-trace-write
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - 'tempo.grafana.com'
resources: 
  - cluster
resourceNames:
  - traces
verbs:
  - 'create' 
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: rhobs-sa-assign-otel-collector-role
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: tempo-allow-trace-write
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: rhobs-sa
  namespace: openshift-observability
EOF
```

#### LokiStack and Cluster Log Forwarder

Like we did for Tempo and OTel, start by creating a `ServiceAccount` for the Loki
instance that will hold our logs internally:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
EOF
```

The OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator will create Cluster Roles that enable
service accounts to obtain application, infrastructure and audit logs from our
cluster and persist them into Loki.

Create a `ClusterRoleBinding` to assign these roles to our `collector`
service account:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: collect-audit-logs
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: collect-audit-logs
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: collect-infrastructure-logs
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: collect-infrastructure-logs
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: collect-application-logs
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: collect-application-logs
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: logging-collector-logs-writer
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: logging-collector-logs-writer
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
EOF
```

### Install the OpenTelemetry Collector

We're now ready to create the OpenTelemetry collector for our cluster. Execute
the `oc` command below to create it:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1beta1

          processors:
            - k8sattributes
          exporters:
            - debug
            - kafka/logs
        metrics:
          receivers:
            - hostmetrics
            - kubeletstats
            - k8s_cluster
          processors:
            - k8sattributes
          exporters:
            - debug
            - kafka/metrics
  env:
    - name: K8S_NODE_NAME
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: spec.nodeName
```

This will create a cluster-wide collector with the following pipelines:

- **Metrics**: Host metrics (CPU, memory, etc) along with Kubernetes cluster and
  Kubelet signals will be enriched with Pod associations and sent to the stdout
  channel of the container running the OpenTelemetry collector process (via the
  `debug` exporter) and to the `metrics-topic` Kafka topic that we will set up
  shortly.
- **Logs**: systemd journal logs (useful for debugging OpenShift node issues),
  Kubernetes logs and Kubernetes events will be sent to the stdout
  channel of the container running the OpenTelemetry collector process (via the
  `debug` exporter) and to the `logs-topic` Kafka topic that we will set up
  shortly.
- **Traces**: An `otlp` compatible HTTP listener will receive spans and send
  them to three places:
  - The stdout channel of the container running the OpenTelemetry collector
    process (via the `debug` exporter), 
  - The `traces-topic` Kafka topic that we will set up soon, and
  - A Tempo instance that we will create soon.

After applying this resource, run `oc logs -n openshift-observability
daemonset/collector` to see the collector receive, enrich and route signals.

![](./include/assets/img/collector.gif)

You'll also see errors from the collector trying to export signals to Tempo and
Kafka. This is expected, as we haven't set those up yet!

### Install and Configure Vector and Loki

We're now going to install the OpenShift Cluster Logging Operator and configure
Vector to send cluster and workload logs to Loki and S3.

While this duplicates log aggregation capabilities built into OpenTelemetry,
CLO enables logs to be seen locally within the OpenShift Console and correlated
to Pods with the Signal Correlation feature provided by the Cluster
Observability Operator.

Run the `oc` command below to deploy a `LokiStack` that will deploy and
configure a local Loki instance:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: logging-loki
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  limits:
    global:
      retention:
        days: 30
  size: 1x.small
  storage:
    schemas:
      - version: v13
        effectiveDate: "2026-02-04" # needs to be set to two months before install date
    secret:
      name: logging-loki-s3
      type: s3
  storageClassName: gp3-csi
  tenants:
    mode: openshift-logging
EOF
```

> 📝 **NOTE**
>
> Change `1x.small` to `1x.pico` if you are deploying the LokiStack into an
> OpenShift cluster with less than 12 CPUs/vCPUs and 32GB RAM.

Run `oc describe lokistack logging-loki -n openshift-logging` to monitor the
installation. The LokiStack is ready when the `ReadyComponents` status becomes
`True`.

Next, run the `oc` command below to create a `ClusterLogForwarder` resource that
will configure Vector to send logs to the Loki instance we deployed earlier:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: collector
  pipelines:
    - name: all-to-lokistack
      inputRefs:
        - application
        - infrastructure
        - audit
      outputRefs:
        - default
  outputs:
    - name: default
      type: lokiStack
      lokiStack:
        authentication:
          token:
            from: serviceAccount
        target:
          name: logging-loki
          namespace: openshift-logging
      tls:
        ca:
          key: service-ca.crt
          configMapName: openshift-service-ca.crt
EOF
```

Run `oc describe clf collector  -n openshift-logging` to monitor the
installation. Log forwarding is ready when the `Ready` status becomes
`True`.

Confirm that Vector is sending logs to Loki by running `oc logs -n
openshift-logging statefulset/logging-loki-ingester`. You should see several
entries containing "flushing stream" if all is working properly.

### Install and configure cluster tracing

Our cluster is now collecting metrics and logs, so it's time to enable cluster
tracing.

Traces are helpful to observe application behavior at transaction-level
granularity, such as the life of a request made to a web application or Pods and
Services reached by a packet flowing through a service mesh.

We will provision a sample application in the next section that uses
OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation to generate spans for requests made to an
AI-generated web server. For now, we will configure the Tempo instance that our
OpenTelemetry collector is attempting to send traces to.

Run the `oc` command below to do that:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: tempo.grafana.com/v1alpha1
kind: TempoStack
metadata:
  name: cluster
  namespace: openshift-observability
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  storage:
    secret:
      name: rhobs-secret-s3
      type: s3
  storageSize: 10Gi
  serviceAccount: rhobs-secret-s3
  tenants:
    mode: openshift
    authentication:
      - tenantName: cluster
        tenantId: "1610b0c3-c509-4592-a256-a1871353dbfa"
  template:
    gateway:
      enabled: true
    queryFrontend:
      jaegerQuery:
        enabled: true
EOF
```

Run `oc describe tempostack cluster  -n openshift-observability` to monitor the
installation. Cluster tracing is ready when the `Ready` status becomes
`True`.

### Deploy the sample app and enable auto instrumentation

First, use the `oc` command below to configure OpenShift tracing to
automatically instrument Golang applications:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: Instrumentation
metadata:
  name: instrumentation
  namespace: openshift-observability
spec:
  exporter:
    endpoint: http://otel-collector.openshift-observability.svc.cluster.local:4318
  env:
    - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT
      value: "20"
    - name: OTEL_GO_AUTO_TARGET_EXE
      value: /opt/app-root/gobinary
  propagators:
    - tracecontext
    - baggage
  sampler:
    type: parentbased_traceidratio
    argument: "1"
EOF
```

Next, create the OpenShift project that will hold our example application:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: example-apps
  annotations:
      security.openshift.io/scc.podSecurityLabelSync: "false"
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: "privileged"
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: "privileged"
      pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: "privileged"
EOF
```

Next, create a Service Account that is able to start privileged Pods. The
sidecar that OpenTelemetry deploys to enable auto-instrumentation uses eBPF to
sample application behavior and generate spans. This requires a privileged
container in order to work.

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: simple-load-tester-sa
  namespace: example-apps

You should also see the log lines below after running `oc logs -n example-apps
deployment/simple-load-tester-web-server --container
opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation` that verifies that instrumentation was
automatically wired with the application:

### Enable the load generator

Use the `oc` command below to add a load generator component to the example web
server. This will issue random `GET` or `POST` HTTP methods to the web server
every second:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap

          command:
            - sh
            - -c
            - |-
              >&2 echo "Waiting 180s for web server to become available at http://$WEB_SERVER_HOST:8080";
              timeout 180s sh -c 'while true; do curl -sS http://$WEB_SERVER_HOST:8080 && exit 0; sleep 1; done'
      containers:

                  key: web_server_host
          command:
            - bash
            - -c
            - |-
              >&2 echo "load-generator has started. Press CTRL-C to stop."
              attempts=0
              iterations=0
              while true
              do
                >&2 echo "---> iteration $((attempts+1))"
                nonce=$((RANDOM % 100))
                test "$(( nonce % 3 ))" -eq 0 && curl -o /dev/null -sS -v "http://$WEB_SERVER_HOST:8080" && continue
                >&2 echo "DEBUG: Payload: $payload"
                curl -v -sS "http://$WEB_SERVER_HOST:8080" --json "$payload"
                sleep $((RANDOM % 3))
                attempts=$((attempts+1))
              done
EOF
```

Run `oc logs -n example-apps deployment simple-load-tester-web-server
--container app` to confirm that the web server is receiving requests:

```text
time="2026-05-29T21:34:43Z" level=info msg="Starting server on :8080"
time="2026-05-29T21:34:46Z" level=info msg="Request handled" elapsed="1.541µs" method=GET path=/
time="2026-05-29T21:34:46Z" level=info msg="Request handled" elapsed="1.197µs" method=GET path=/

time="2026-05-29T21:34:48Z" level=info msg="Request handled" elapsed="1.283µs" method=POST path=/
```

Afterwards, run `oc logs -n openshift-observability daemonset/collector` to
confirm that spans from the instrumentation sidecar are being sent to the
OpenTelemetry collector.

```text
oc logs -n openshift-observability -l app.kubernetes.io/component=opentelemetry-collector -f | grep -E 'Trace ID.*[a-zA-Z0-9].*'
```

You should see traces with Trace IDs like shown below:

```text
Trace ID       : 282f46893b4bc908ff14e9315e1719a8
Trace ID       : 118ecd7425c3ec85715cade70282ba2e

```

### Install Streams for Apache Kafka and the Kafka Console

Now that our cluster is collecting all of the key observability signals we'll
need, let's install and configure a Kafka cluster with the topics that
OpenTelemetry is attempting to send data to.

#### Install the Kafka Cluster

First, install the Kafka cluster:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: kafka-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    version: 4.2.0
    metadataVersion: 4.2-IV1
    listeners:
      - name: plain
        port: 9092
        type: internal
        tls: false
      - name: tls
        port: 9093
        type: internal
        tls: true
      - name: listener1
        port: 9094
        type: route
        tls: true
    config:
      offsets.topic.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.replication.factor: 1
      transaction.state.log.min.isr: 1
      default.replication.factor: 1
      min.insync.replicas: 1
  entityOperator:
    topicOperator: {}
    userOperator: {}
---
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1
kind: KafkaNodePool
metadata:
  name: kafka-node-pool
  namespace: rhobs-messaging
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-cluster
spec:
  replicas: 1
  roles:
    - controller
    - broker
  storage:
    type: jbod
    volumes:
      - id: 0
        type: persistent-claim
        size: 100Gi
        kraftMetadata: shared
EOF
```

Run `oc describe kafka kafka-cluster  -n rhobs-messaging` to monitor the
installation. Log forwarding is ready when the `Ready` status becomes
`True`.

#### Install the Kafka Console

Next, provision a simple console that we'll use to see messages being sent to
our signal topics.

```sh
cluster_domain=$(oc get route -n openshift-console console -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}' |
    sed 's;console-openshift-console.;;')
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: console.streamshub.github.com/v1alpha1
kind: Console
metadata:
  name: rhobs-console
  namespace: rhobs-messaging
spec:
  hostname: kafka-console.$cluster_domain
  kafkaClusters:
    - name: kafka-cluster
      namespace: rhobs-messaging
      listener: plain
EOF
```

For convenience, run the `oc` command below to add a tile to the OpenShift
console that takes you to the Kafka Console in one click:

```sh
cluster_domain=$(oc get route -n openshift-console console -o jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}' |
    sed 's;console-openshift-console.;;')
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: console.openshift.io/v1
kind: ConsoleLink
metadata:
  name: kafka-console
spec:
  applicationMenu:
    imageURL: /static/assets/public/imgs/logos/amq.svg
    section: Consoles
  href: https://kafka-console.$cluster_domain
  location: ApplicationMenu
  text: Streams for Apache Kafka Console
EOF
```

After a minute or so, go back to the OpenShift console. You'll be asked to log
in again. After doing so, click on the Tiles and select "Streams for Apache
Kafka Console" to be taken to the console. Click the "Log in anonymously" button to log in.

![](./include/assets/img/kafka_console_login.png)

You'll be presented with an overview of the Kafka cluster that you created. Keep
this tab or window open, as we will return to it momentarily.

#### Create the observability signal topics

Finally, use the command below to create Kafka topics for our metrics, logs and
traces:

```sh
for t in metrics logs traces
do
  oc apply -f <<-EOF
apiVersion: kafka.strimzi.io/v1beta2
kind: KafkaTopic
metadata:
  name: "${t}-topic"
  namespace: rhobs-messaging
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-cluster
spec:
  topicName: "${t}-topic"
EOF
done
```

Go back to the Kafka console, refresh the page, then click on "Topics."

![](./include/assets/img/kafka_console_topics.png)

You should see three topics in the console. Click on any of them. You should see
messages appear in the topic momentarily. Keep refreshing to see them pile up!

![](./include/assets/img/kafka_console_topics_example.png)

### Install Cluster Observability UI Plugins

Finally, we are going to use the Cluster Observability Operator to enable the
Signal Correlation feature as well as the "Traces" Observe tab in the Console.

Use the `oc` command below to create an `ObservabilityInstaller` instance:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: ObservabilityInstaller
metadata:
  name: rhobs
  namespace: openshift-observability
spec:
  capabilities:
    tracing:
      enabled: true
      operators:
        install: false
      storage:
        objectStorage:
          s3CCO:
            bucket: not-used
            region: us-east-2
EOF
```

> 📝 **NOTE**
>
> The Cluster Observabilty Operator is capable of provisioning Tempo and
> OpenTelemetry together. We are not taking advantage of this feature in our
> demo since our OpenTelemetry instance is using more advanced configuration to
> enable signals to be exported to multiple external systems. Instead, we're
> purely using the `ObservabilityInstaller` resource above to enable the
> **Traces** view in the **Observe** section of the OpenShift Console.

Next, enable the logging, monitoring and troubleshooting UI plugins:

```sh
oc apply -f - <<-EOF
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UIPlugin
metadata:
  name: logging
spec:
  type: Logging
  logging:
    lokiStack:
      name: logging-loki
    logsLimit: 50
    timeout: 30s
    schema: otel
---
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UIPlugin
metadata:
  name: monitoring
spec:
  type: Monitoring
  monitoring:
    # This enables ACM features.
    acm:
      enabled: true
      alertmanager:
        url: "https://alertmanager.open-cluster-management-observability.svc:8443"
      thanosQuerier:
        url: "https://rbac-query-proxy.open-cluster-management-observability.svc:8443"
      # enables mapping alerts to components
    clusterHealthAnalyzer:
      enabled: true
---
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UIPlugin
metadata:
  name: troubleshooting-panel
spec:
  type: TroubleshootingPanel
EOF
```

Visit the OpenShift Console for your cluster. You might be asked to log in
again.

Click on **Observe**. You should now see **Traces** and **Logs** in the sidebar.

![](./include/assets/img/observe_sidebar.png)

Click on the tiles to the left of the bell. You should see a "Signal
Correlation" tile in the dropdown.

![](./include/assets/img/signals_dropdown.png)

🎉 Congratulations! You've configured the demo environment and are ready to
explore the demo provided in the [Demo](#demo) section!
